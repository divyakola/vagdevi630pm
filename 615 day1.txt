			Python
			------
what is Python?
---------------
python is a General Purpose programming language
python is a High-level programming language
python is a multi-paradigm
python supporting both interactive and Batch Mode

	(or)

python is a General purpose,high-level,interpreted,interactive,
dynamically-typed,garbage collected,modular,procedure-oriented,
object-oriented and scripting programming language.

History of Python:
------------------
	the Python was developed by the Guido Van Rossum in the year of 1991(actually this project implementation started in the year of 1989).

	the name python was derived from the Guido Van Rossum Favourite TV fun show "the complete monty python's flying circus".

	he is a Dutch Programmer

	currently he is working on developer divisin at microsoft.

advantages of Python:
---------------------
1).Simple syntax
	in python,theres no concept of ;,(),{}
	python simply follows space indentation concept

ex: if block representation

	c/c++/java			python
	----------			------
	if(condition)			if condition:
	  {					statement_1
           statement_1;				statement_2
             statement_2;			........
	   ......				statement_n
	 statement_n;
          }

2).Less Code

	python programs haveing lesscode when compared to other programming langauges programs code like c,c++,java,....

ex:
---
write a c-program,to print "hello world")

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
  printf("hello world");
}


write a java-program,to print "hello world"?

import java.io.*;
class Test
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    System.out.println("hello world");
   }
}

write a python-program,to print "hello world"?

print("hello world")

3).dynamically typed

ex:
--
write a c-program(static typed) to perform the addition opertaion on two different type of values?

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
  int x=10;
  float y=2.3;
  float z=x+y;
  printf(z);
  
}

write a python-program(dynamic typed) to perform the addition opertaion on two different type of values?

x=10
y=2.3
z=x+y
print(z)

Features of Python:
-------------------
1).Easy-to-Learn
2).Easy-to-Read
3).Easy-to-maintain
4).Easy-to-Use
5).portable/crossplatform(it support all operating systems)
6).scalable(easily we can add new features)
7).Secure
8).Flexible
9).platform independent(write once run anywhere)
10).strongly typed
11).free and Opensource
12).it support all types of database connections.

note:
----
python is a free and Opensource,it is maintained by PSF(Python Software Foundation) team.


applications of Python/where we are using Python:
------------------------------------------------
1).Automation Applications
	Robotics	--> Artificial Intelligence(AI)

2).Data Science
	Machine Learning(ML)
	Deep Learning(DL)
	Natural Langauge Processing(NLP)
	Image Processing

3).Bigdata-Hadoop
	store	--> HDFS

	process	  --> mapreduce
	
		      spark
			python/scala

4).web application development
	python + Django/Flask/Bottle/web2py/cherryPI/pyramid,...

5).DevOps
	cheff,puppet,docker,ansible,jenkins,ansible,kubernets,
        maven,vagrant,git,github,splunk,...

19).Blockchain

20).ETL(Extract Transformation and Loading)

21).BI(Business Intelligence)

22).ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning)
	odoo

23).web scrapping

24).Bio-Informatics/Life-science

Implementation of Python:
-------------------------
	the Guido Van Rossum to implement the python programming language by takeing the different varities of Features from different types of programming languages.

	1).python language supporting Function's concept,these concept takes from Procedure-Oriented Programming Languages.

	ex: C-language

	2).python language supporting OOP's concepts,these concepts takes from Object-Oriented Programming Langauges.

	ex: C++

	3).python language supporting DDT(Dynamic Datatypes) and Interpreter concepts,these two concepts takes Scripting programming Languages.

	ex: Shell-Scripting

	4).python language supporting module's concept,these concept takes from modular programming languages.

	ex:modula3


python distributions:
----------------------
	the python runtime environment is implemented by using 		c-language,is known as a "Cpython".

	Cpython is a standard python distribution

	the python runtime environment is implemented by using java language,is known as "Jython".

	the python runtime environment is implemented by using .Net languages(C#,Asp.Net,...),is known as a "IronPython".

	the python runtime environment is implemented by using python language,is known as a "PYPY".

	the python runtime environment is implemented by using Rust language,is known as a "RustPython".

	the python runtime environment is implemented based on Embedded systems,is known as a "EmbeddedPython".

	the python runtime environment is implemented by Anaconda corporation,is known as a "AnacondaPython".

	.........,etc.,


how to represent the comments in python?
----------------------------------------
	Generally the comments can be categorized into two types,they are

	1).single-line comment

	2).multi-line comment

single-line comment
-------------------
	c-language			python
	----------			-------
	// comment_line			# comment_line

multi-line comment
------------------
	c-language			python
	----------			-------
	/* comment_line_1		''' comment_line_1
	   comment_line_2		    comment_line_2
	   ..........			    ........
	   comment_line_n */		    comment_line_n '''

versions of python:
-------------------
initially python released into the market in the year of 1991

python1.0 version is released into the market in the year of 1994

the python1.x(1.0,1.1,....,1.x) these versions dont supporting Garbage Collector concept.

python2.0 version is released into the market in the year of 2000

from python2.0 versions onwards python language also supporting Garbage Collector concept.

python3.0 version is released into the market in the year of 2008

	python2.x	--> 2.0,2.1,....,2.7.18

	python3.x	--> 3.0,3.1,....,3.9.7

disadvantages:
--------------
slower execution
