		File-Handling
		------------
	Generally the programming languages are suitable for processing the data.

	the programming languages are not suitable storeing the data because the programming languages programs memory will be allocated in RAM.

	RAM(Random Access Memory) is a Volatile memory i.e., once program execution is over/turnoff our computer/poweroff then automatically to errase the data from RAM.

	if we are not store the data permanently,it is not suitable for use that data in future.
	
	if we want to store the data permanently in a non-volatile memory like Harddisk by using following concepts,they are

	File's
	Database's
	HDFS
	...
	...

what is File?
-------------
	a file is a named location on the disk,which is used to store the data permanently in a non-volatile memory like harddisk for future use/purpose.

	the different file formates are .txt
					.csv
					.json
					.xlsx
					.pdf
					.docs

if we want to working with files first we need to open a file.

we can open a file by using open() of builtins module.

at the time of opening a file we need to specify the mode of that file.

	mode		Description
	----		-----------
	r	-->	open a file in read mode
			(it's by default)

	w	-->	open a file in write mode,if file already 			existed in that case to delete the data 			from that file and to add new data into 			that file otherwise to create a new file 			and to write the data into that new file.

	a	-->	open a file in append mode,if file 			already existed in that case the data 			will be added at the end of the already 			existed data otherwise to create a new 			file and write the data into that file. 

	x	-->	open a file in exclusive creation mode,if 			file already existed the operation become 			Fail otherwise to create a new file and 			to write the data into that file.

	t	-->	open a file in text mode
			(it's by default)

	b	-->	open a file in bytes mode

	+	-->	to apply the multiple modes
			w+b or wb

the open() to return the file object.

the file object provides some methods,to perform the operation on the files.

	method		Description
	------		-----------
	read()		to read entire data from the file

	read(n)		to read 'n'-charecters from the file

	readline()	to read the line from the file

	readlines()	to read all the lines from the file

	write(s)	to write the data into the file

	writelines()	to write the lines into the file

	seek()		to change the file pointer position

	tell()		to return the current file pointer 			position.

	close()		to close the file

after performeing the operation on the files next we need to close the file.

we can close the file by calling close() of file object

order of the file handling
--------------------------
	step1:
	-----
	open a file

	file_obj=open('filename','mode')

	ex:
	---
	f1=open('sample.txt') #read and text mode

	f2=open('sample.txt','w') #write and text mode

	f3=open('E:\\siva\\sample.txt','a') #append mode

	f4=open('E:/siva/sample.txt','x') #exclusive creation

	step2:
	-----
	to perform the operation on the files

	file_obj.methodname()

	ex:
	---
	f1.read()

	f2.write(string)

	step3:
	-----
	to close the file

	file_obj.close()

	ex:
	--
	f1.close()

ex1:
---
wap to read the data from the file?

	sample.txt
	---------
hai siva

f1=open('sample.txt')
print(f1.read())
f1.close()

output:
------
hai siva

ex2:
---
	sample.txt
	---------
hai siva


f1=open('sample.txt')
x=f1.read()
print(x)
print(f1.name)
print(f1.mode)
print("Before:",f1.closed)
f1.close()
print("After:",f1.closed)

output:
-------
hai siva
sample.txt
r
Before: False
After: True

ex3:
---
write a program to write the data into the file by using 'w' mode,if file already existed?

	sample.txt
	---------
hai siva


f1=open('sample.txt','w')
f1.write("hello krishna good evening")
f1.close()

output:
------
	sample.txt
	---------
hello krishna good evening

ex4:
---
write a program to write the data into the file by using 'w' mode,if file does not existed?

f1=open('sample1.txt','w')
f1.write("hello krishna")
f1.close()

output:
------
	sample1.txt
	----------
hello krishna

ex5:
---
write a program to write the data into the file by using 'a' mode,if file already existed?

	sample1.txt
	----------
hello krishna

f1=open('sample1.txt','a')
f1.write("how are you")
f1.close()

output:
------
	sample1.txt
	----------
hello krishnahow are you

ex6:
---
write a program to write the data into the file by using 'a' mode,if file doesnot existed?

f1=open('sample2.txt','a')
f1.write("how are you")
f1.close()

output:
-----
	sample2.txt
	----------
how are you

ex7:
---
write a program to write the data into the file by using 'x' mode,if file already existed?

	sample2.txt
	----------
how are you

f1=open('sample2.txt','x')
f1.write("good evening")
f1.close()

output:
------
FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists: 'sample2.txt'

ex8:
---
write a program to write the data into the file by using 'x' mode,if file doesnot existed?

f1=open('sample3.txt','x')
f1.write("good evening")
f1.close()

output:
-----
	sample3.txt
	-----------
good evening
