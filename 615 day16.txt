		Control flow statements
		----------------------
these statements are used to control the flow of the program execution.

why we need to control the flow of the program execution?
--------------------------------------------------------
	by default any programming language program,all the statements are executed at only once/onetime.


	if we want to execute some statements repeatedly/repeated no.of times,if we want to skip the execution some statements,in these two scenarios to control the flow of the program execution.

how to control the flow of the program execution?
------------------------------------------------
	we can control the flow of the program execution by using control-flow statements.

	the control flow statements can be categorized into 3-types,they are

	1).Conditional/Sequential statements

	2).Looping/Iterative statements

	3).Jumping/Transform statements

elements of control flow statements:
-----------------------------------
	the elements of control flow statements are
		1).condition
		2).block/clause

what is Condition?
-----------------
	any expression to return the output as boolean values,that type of Expressions are called Conditions.

	
ex:
---
x=10,y=3

x+y	--> 13		--> expression
x-y	--> 7		--> expression
x*y	--> 30		--> expression
x==y	--> False	--> expression		--> condition
x>y	--> True	--> expression		--> condition
x<y	--> False	--> expression		--> condition
x&y	--> 2		--> expression
x|y	--> 11		--> expression

note:
-----
all conditions are expressions but all expressions are not conditions

what is Block/Clause?
----------------------
	in python,the group of statements which are following same space indentation,is known as a Block/Clause.

	c/c++/java		python
	-----------		-------
	stmt_1			stmt_1
	stmt_2			stmt_2
        {			     stmt_a
          stmt_a		     stmt_b
	  stmt_b		     ......
	  ......	             stmt_z
	  stmt_z		stmt_n-1
         }			stmt_n
        stmt_n-1
	stmt_n

Conditional statements:
-----------------------
	these statements are used to execute the block of statements or to skip the execution of block of statements or to execute the one block of statements among from multiple blocks of statements.

	in python,the conditional statements are
			if
			if else
			if elif else

if block
---------
	we can define any block which is preceeded by 'if' keyword that block is called if block.

	syntax
	------
	if condition: statement

		(or)

	if condition:
		statement_1
		statement_2
		..........
		statement_n

whenever 'if' condition is True then only control will goto 'if' block and 'if' block will be executed otherwise control dont goto the if block.

ex1:
---
print("hai")
age=int(input("enter your age: "))
if age>18:print("hello siva")
print("bye")
    
outputs:
--------
hai
enter your age: 17
bye


enter your age: 20
hello siva
bye

ex2:
----
print("hai")
age=int(input("enter your age: "))
if age>18:
    print("hello siva")
    print("Good Evening")
print("bye")
    
outputs:
--------
hai
enter your age: 17
bye


hai
enter your age: 20
hello siva
Good Evening
bye

if else
--------
	if condition:
		statement_1
		statement_2
		...........
		statement_n
	else:
	     statement_1
	     statement_2
	     ........
	     statement_n

whenever 'if' condition is True then only control will goto 'if' block and 'if' block will be executed otherwise control will goto 'else' block and 'else' block will be executed.

ex1:
---
print("hai")
age=int(input("enter your age: "))
if age>18:
    print("hello siva")
    print("Good Evening")
else:
    print("hello krishna")
    print("Good Morning")    
print("bye")
 
outputs:
--------   
hai
enter your age: 13
hello krishna
Good Morning
bye


hai
enter your age: 20
hello siva
Good Evening
bye

ex2:
---
x=int(input("enter x value: "))
y=int(input("enter y value: "))
if x>y:
    print("x is Greaterthan y")
else:
    print("x is Lessthan y")

outputs:
-------
enter x value: 3
enter y value: 4
x is Lessthan y


enter x value: 5
enter y value: 2
x is Greaterthan y

ex3:
---
x=int(input("enter x value: "))
y=int(input("enter y value: "))
if x>y:
    print("%d is Greaterthan %d"%(x,y))
else:
    print("{} is Lessthan {}".format(x,y))

output:
------
enter x value: 3
enter y value: 2
3 is Greaterthan 2


enter x value: 2
enter y value: 6
2 is Lessthan 6

ex3:
---
x=int(input("enter x value: "))
y=int(input("enter y value: "))
if x>y:
    print(f"{x} is Greaterthan {y}")
else:
    print(f"{x} is Lessthan {y}")

output:
------
enter x value: 2
enter y value: 6
2 is Lessthan 6


enter x value: 3
enter y value: 1
3 is Greaterthan 1

assignment-1:
-------------
