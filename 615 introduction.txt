what is Programming Language?
-----------------------------
	a Language is a Set of Instructions to intend the computer or machine for performeing a one task,that langauge is a called Programming Langauge.

level's of Programming langauges:
----------------------------------
	the Programming Langauges can be categorized into two level's they are

	1).High-Level Programming Languages

	2).Low-Level Programming Langauges

Low-Level Programming Langauges:
--------------------------------
	any programming language which is understanding by computer-processor directly,that type of programming languages are called Low-Level Programming Languages.

	ex: Micro-Processor(8086,8085)
	    Micro-Controller(8051)
	    RaspberryPI
	    ArduinoPI

High-Level Programming Languages:
---------------------------------
	any programming language which is understanding by      Human-Being,that type of programming langauges are called High-Level Programming Langauges.

	ex: C,C++,Python,Java,.Net languages(C#,Asp.Net,....),
	    Php,Ruby,shell-scripting,java-script,perl,
	    powershell-scripting,Go-lang,Scala,julia,Rust,
	    modula,modula2,modula3,....

Types of High-Level Programming Langauges:
------------------------------------------
	the High-Level Programming Languages can be categorized into 4-types,they are

	1).Procedure-Oriented Programming Languages
	
	2).Object-Oriented Programming Langauges

	3).Scripting Programming Languages

	4).Modular Programming Languages

Procedure-Oriented Programming Languages:
------------------------------------------
	any high-level programming language which support Functions concept,that type of High-Level programming languages are called Procedure-Oriented Programming Languages(POPL)

	ex: C-language,Python

Object-Oriented Programming Langauges:
---------------------------------------
	any high-level programming langauge which support OOP's concepts,that type of High-Level Programming Langauges are called Object-Oriented Programming Langauges(OOPL)

	OOP's means Object Oriented Programming Principles/concepts.

	the OOP's concepts are
		Class
		Object
		Encapsulation
		Inheritance
		Polymorphism
		Data-Abstraction

	we can developing any one application according these OOP's concepts we will get some benefits in that application.

	the Benefits of OOP's concepts are
		Security
		Reusability
		Flexibility

	ex: C++,Python,Java,.Net languages,...

Scripting Programming Languages:
--------------------------------
	any High-Level Programming Langauge which support Dynamic Datatypes and Interpreter concepts,that type of High-Level Programming languages are called Scripting Programming Languages(SPL).

	ex: shell-scripting,python,javascript,....

Modular Programming Languages:
------------------------------
	any high-level programming language which support modules concept,that type of high-level programming languages are called Modular Programming Languages(MPL).

	ex: modula,modula2,modula3,python

what is Compiler?
----------------
	a compiler is a predefined program,which is used to convert source code(Human Understandable Format) into machine code(Machine Understandable Format).

	any high-level programming language which support compiler,that type of programming languages are called compiled programming languages.

	ex: C,C++,Java,.Net,....


what is Interpreter?
--------------------
	a interpreter is a predefined program,which is used to convert source code into machine code.

	any programming language which support Interpreter concept that type of programming languages are called Interpreted programming languages.

	ex: python,javascript,shell-scripting,....


what is Garbage Collector?
--------------------------
	Garbage Collector is a Predefined program,which is used to deallocate the memory sapce for unused or unreferenced objects automatically.

	once Garbage collector is executed more memory space is available so that the rest of the program execution become Fast.

	the garbage collector supported langauges are java,python,
	.Net,Php,Ruby,....

	any programming langauge which support Garbage Collector,that type of programming lanagauges are called Garbage collected languages.
