what is an Algorithm?
---------------------
	Algorithm is a step-by-step process to implement the solution for the given problem.

	Algorithm is a Natural Language

ex:
--
write an algorithm to perform addition of two numbers?

step1: start
step2: takes the inputs from the user
step3: to perform the addition operation
step4: to return the result
step5: stop

ex2:
----
write an algorithm to check wheather given number is Even or Odd?

step1: start
step2: take the number from the user
step3: if number is divisible by 2
          then to return given number is Even
       else 
	  to return given number is Odd
step4: stop

what is Flowchart?
------------------
	a flowchart is a visual/pictorial representation of an algorithm for easily understanding.

what is PsuedoCode?
-------------------
Psuedocode is a mixing of natural langauge and programming language.

it is common for all the programming language

ex:
--
write a psuedocode to perform the addition of two numbers?

input: x=10,y=20
process: sum=x+y
output: print sum

what is program?
-------------
a program is a set of instructions to intend the computer or machine for performeing a one task.

ex:
---
write a c-program to perform addition of two numbers?

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
 int x=10,y=20,sum;
 sum=x+y;
 printf(sum);
}

ex:
---
write a python program to pritn addtion of two numbers;

x=10;y=20;sum
sum=x+y
print(sum)


what is Python?
---------------
python is a General purpose programming Langauge
python is a High-Level Programming Langauge
python is a multi-paradigm
python langauge supporting both interactive and batch mode

		(or)

Python is a General-purpose,High-Level,Interpreted,Interactive,
Dynamically typed,garbage-collected,modular,procedure-oriented, object-oriented and Scripting Programming langauge.
